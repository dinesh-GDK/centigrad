# &#x1F52E; centigrad
Autograd engine and neural network library based on numpy(for now).

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

Unlike [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) which uses scalars, **centigrad** uses matrices.

## Disclaimer
This is work in progress, so a lot of things will change.
